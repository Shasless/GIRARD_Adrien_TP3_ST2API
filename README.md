# TP3Csharp ST2 API
Adrien GIRARD

In order to execute the project open the c# project, dowload the dependence required (newtonsoft ..) and execute the project projet. You can also go in the programme __exe file and execute WeatherReport


Question:

1. I didnt encouter large problems during the realisation of tp2. In fact the course of the last semester with mister Fontana give me everything that i need to realize this tp
2. SOLID principle:  Single-responsibility principle Openâ€“closed principle Liskov substitution principle Interface segregation principle and the Dependency inversion principle . All this principle have for goal to improve object oriented programm. To make them more understandable, efficient, and resiliant. 
KISS is for  keep it simple, stupid. This principale is intended not to complicate what does not need to be complicated. It is obviously much easier to maintain and understand simple code. However, sometimes complexity is necessary in order to achieve certain functionality.Most programmers know the "Boy Scout Rule": "Always leave the code better than you found it". This rule of being a good citizen is a miracle cure for technical debt.
Clean code is code that is easy to understand, maintain and improve, all without compromising the quality of code execution.
3. There are a lot of improvement voices compared to the tp2. The first one is simply to be able to select the place where you want to know the weather, and to make sure that this choice doesn't lead to a bug. We can also want to have the weather forecast for the next few days. We can also think about a graphical interface that will show us all the data we want. Or a map that would allow us to select the area from which we want the weather.



Use:

Once the application is launched you will find yourself with a world map on the right side of the screen.

You can zoom in and out and move around.

On this map is displayed the clouds and in blue the clouds raining at this moment. You can click on a location on the map and click on go to get the weather for that city and the 4 day forecast.
